## 2026-04-12 — Remove local mode from CLI (Stream B)

**Pages updated:** index, architecture, data-flow, go-cli, data-model, authentication, conventions, metrics

**Summary:** Updated all wiki pages to reflect the removal of local mode from the Go CLI (ADR-014, Stream B). The CLI is now a thin client that parses Claude Code sessions and pushes them to the managed service. Removed all references to SQLite, `ax sync`, `ax report`, `ax status`, `ax export`, `ax dashboard`, `ax watch`, and the deleted packages (`internal/sync/`, `internal/watch/`, `internal/export/`, `internal/correlator/`, `internal/db/`). Updated architecture diagrams, command tables, package structures, and data flow descriptions.

## 2026-04-12 — Initial wiki creation

**Pages created:** index, architecture, data-flow, go-cli, rails-server, dashboard, metrics, data-model, authentication, conventions

**Summary:** Built the full repository wiki covering all three components (Go CLI, Rails server, Next.js dashboard), how they connect, the 16 metrics and their lifecycle, both database schemas, authentication mechanisms, data flow paths, and coding conventions. Derived from a comprehensive codebase review.
